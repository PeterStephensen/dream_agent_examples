#----------------------------------------------------------------
# In this tutorial we add agent interaction: You will learn:
# 1) How an agent do a random search
# 2) How agents communicate
# 3) How agents transfers money
# 4) Showing a histogram
#----------------------------------------------------------------
# We model a system of persons that randomly attack each other(!). Each person has a normally distributed 'strength'.
# You do not know the strength of your opponent when you attack. The strongest win and the looser pays a share
# of his wealth to the winner. We show a real-time-histogram of the wealth distribution.

# Communication protocol (described later)
#---------------------------
class ECommunication(Enum):
    YOU_WIN = 1
    YOU_LOSE = 2
    I_ATTACK = 3

class Event(Enum):
    START = 1         # The model starts
    STOP = 2          # The model stops
    PERIOD_START = 3  # The start of a period
    UPDATE = 4        # Stuff that happens in the period

# The Settings object
#---------------------------
class Settings: pass

# The Person object
#---------------------------
# #1) Everybody starts with 1 unit of wealth (equal wealth distribution) and normally distributed strength

# #2) At Event.update the person attacks a random other person with probability Settings.attack_probability.
# The person uses the method Simulation.population.get_random_agent(self) to do a random search. It is important to
# use self as an argument to make sure that the person do not find itself in the search.
# The person sends the message ECommunication.I_attack to the random person p. Person p responds with
# ECommunication.you_win or ECommunication.you_lose (see later). If the reply is ECommunication.you_lose, the person has
# to pay a share Settings.loot_share of its wealth to the person p. This is done with the transfer_to-method (see later)

# #3) The communicate-method is the basic way to model interaction. This and the enumeration ECommunicate defines
# the communication protocol. ECommunicate is the 'language' used by the agents, and the communicate-method defines the
# Q&A-structure. You contact a person by using her communicate-method, and her answer is what the communication-method returns.
# If a person receives the message ECommunication.I_attack it can return ECommunication.you_win or ECommunication.you_lose.
# If the sender of the message is stronger than you (if self._strength < person._strength), you transfer money to the sender and
# returns ECommunication.you_win. If you are stronger yor return ECommunication.you_lose (the sender then transfers money to you).

# #4) Transferring money between two agents is an action that has simultaneous impact on both agents. This is best
# modelled by a single method. If you are transferring money to another person, money are subtracted from your
# wealth and added to the other persons wealth. That is what happens in the transfer_to-method.
